## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed this bot as a way for our team to easily help out new users, and to provide an automated way of handling spam.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This guide will walk you through the process of using my setup script to get your your own instance of the bot up and running as easily and smoothly as possible! If you would rather use the manual install instructions, you can find them [HERE](./manualInstallInstructions.md). 

## ✔ Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

If you choose to use my setup script then it will install *all* of the necessary missing dependencies, get all your files ready, and leave you with a completely prepared environment for your bot! Any tokens you are missing can be provided by a team member that already has them.

## 💻 Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

 If you've gotten the tokens and are ready to install the bot, you can download the install script [HERE](https://github.com/Clonephaze/DtgA-Discord-Bot/releases/latest) and place it anywhere you would like you would like the folder for your bot to live! For instance, if placed in the Documents folder the bots folder will be located at: "Documents/DtgA-Discord-Bot".

After that last prompt it will close and you're left with a completely prepared environment for your bot!


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

If you look inside "DtgA-Discord-Bot" you'll see a file named "bot start.bat", go ahead and run that file to start the bot. This file will check the repo for any updates and download them if there are any, then logs the bot in.
